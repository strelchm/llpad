# Architecture Overview
- LLPAD is not read the entire file at once.
- So in order to correspond to a big file it reads a small part of the file into buffer(CachedArea).
- The area to be displayed in the text area is called viewArea and displays a part of the buffer.
- When the caret is moved, the viewArea also moves, and when the viewArea reaches the end of the buffer, the next area is read into the buffer.
